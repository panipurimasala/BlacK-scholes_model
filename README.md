# BlacK-scholes_model

This project is supposed to be a fully fledged black scholes calculator. However, the user interface has not been fully implemented yet. 

So far it contains one file. This file is simply an ipynb file where I utilize the black scholes model and test it out. 

I use the yahoo finance package to get options contracts and use the different metrics to price the contract at its price.
